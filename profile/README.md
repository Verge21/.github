## Our Journey
The journey of verge in itself is a story of pride and an initiative to bring something new and innovative to the university. 

In 2019 the idea of verge was plotted as a blur picture. The journey of verge started as ‘VERGE-The techfest’, which emerged as something with a higher purpose that it now chases. The idea was given by the club president Archit Raj and was well supported by Dr. M. Mohan. The idea was to bring students to compete and showcase their skills with full enthusiasm in different technical fields. The techfest was the best idea to bring students together to perform various activities and learn from them. 

In November 2019 the first techfest of SRM University was hosted in which students from 12 colleges participated. The techfest included several activities such as coding competitions, gaming, robotics etc. Different teams were created to plan and conduct the activities and were independent to make decisions regarding problems and difficulties faced and how to solve them, thus promoting a culture of decision making and trust between the teams. ‘Verge’ means an extreme limit beyond which something specified will happen and standing up to that, the fest was a big hit following which, Verge transformed into a proper club. With a skilled team assembled, the club’s aim was to be successful as a platform for helping students and people. 

Verge has 2 main objectives, first is to provide opportunities to students at our University to explore how projects are worked upon. Freshers are trained for the corporate life that can be achieved by giving them the opportunity to work on real-time projects. We also include conducting events, fests, seminars, webinars, workshops, etc. Second is delivering excellent experiences via projects for the clients. We take up consultancy projects and provide solutions to various sectors. We perform real time projects in different domains like app development, website development, and so on.

The greatest achievement of Verge so far is to have achieved the original idea and we strive to keep working on it progressively. 

Our successful projects include:
- VERGE Tech Fest 2019
- Android development for Bid Cars ( An application for car bidding)
- Android & Ios Development for Sai Sanjeevani Hospital ( An application for hospitals to maintain and manage their activities)
- Development of multiple websites including website for VERGE SRM. 

In the future, Verge has much more to showcase and hopes to capture many verges of success and achievement.
